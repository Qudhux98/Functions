# Functions

1.  Function is a block of reusable code that perform a specific task.
2.  Like i stated earlier, functions are crucial when it comes to programming
3.  As a matter of fact, they are the cornerstone of any programming language
4.  Some of the key concepts one needs to understand include ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

    âœ… Function Basics
    âœ… Function Expression
    âœ… Arrow Function
    âœ… Higher Order Function
    âœ… Callback Function
    âœ… Closure
    âœ… Recursion
    âœ… Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) etc.

5.  In this module, I wrote a sample code on how some of the aforementioned concepts can be implemented
6.  The different programs in this perform diffent functions. These include:
    âœ… Banking app (_using closure_): In this app, you can deposit, withraw and check balance
    âœ… Countdown timer (_using closure_): This program counts down time
    âœ… Prime number detector (_using arrow function_): This app helps detect and print any prime number found within any range
    âœ… Multiplication program (_using recursion_): This program run any multiplication from 1 to 12 for any given number
    âœ… Binary Converter (_using recursion_): This app converts any number to base 2 or binary
7.  As regards the last program (Binary converter), even tho there is shoeter and better way to do it (i.e just running "_toString_" method on the given number) right, i decided to test my reasoning ability by using recursion.
8.  Continuing from where we left off.............................
9.  There are these powerful array methods that can be undermine when working on a large project
10. These methods are shift, unshift, pop and push
11. In this update, I used the method shift, unshift, pop and push to rotate an array rightward and leftward.
